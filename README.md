# Web-Assignments <br>
Contains various files I used to build a sample website. <br>
<br> Event Registration Website.
<br>
This web project comes in three parts, the event manager, participant, and admin.<br>
- As a participant, one can view nearby events, register/signup for events, register an account, view their event history and listings, create an event. <br>
- As an event manager, one can view, delete, edit their listed events, create new events and view participants. <br>
- The admin controls the website and manages event managers and participants. <br>
<br>
*Contains other unrelated files.*
